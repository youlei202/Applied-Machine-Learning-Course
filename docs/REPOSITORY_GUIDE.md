# Repository guide

This repository is the companion codebase for an Applied Machine Learning course.

## Key folders

- `slides/` — lecture slides (PDF)
- `notebooks/` — lecture notebooks (Jupyter)
- `src/aml_course/` — small helper utilities imported by notebooks
- `scripts/` — standalone scripts (e.g., model training)
- `models/` — small pretrained artifacts used by some notebooks
- `data/` — datasets (downloaded or placed manually)
- `pictures/` — generated plots saved from notebooks

## Reproducibility

Notebooks include a small setup cell at the top to make paths consistent and avoid "it works on my machine" issues.
